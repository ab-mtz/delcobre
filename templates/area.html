   <h2>Area </h2>
    <p clas="introduction"> Copper Canyon is located in the Tarahumara Sierra, southwest of Chihuahua, Mexico. It is a canyon system approximately four times larger and deeper than the Colorado Canyon in Arizona, USA.
            Some of the well-known regions in the area include Parque Nacional Cascada de Basaseachi, the town of Creel, Guachochi, Urique (known for Ultratrail Withe Horse), and the area where Divisadero and Adventure Park Barrancas del Cobre are situated. This region is commonly referred to as Barrancas del Cobre (Copper Canyon) in terms of tourism.
            Divisadero's station, located at km 622 of the passenger train route Chihuahua-Pac√≠fico, popularly known as El Chepe, is one of the most famous and visited stations. This is due to its breathtaking views and the nearby adventure park, which features one of the longest trams in Latin America and the longest zipline in the world. </p>
