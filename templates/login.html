    <div class="textContainer"><h2>Camping</h2>
        <p>The camping area at Mogotabo's community is a project that still in developement. The objectives are to give te possibility to the community to get some extra incomes to finance
            they're other projects and the option for an economic activity for the people of the community. As well, to get the local community and the climbing community in contact and interaction.
            We belive that climbers and local communities must not be sepparate and we want to encourage the cultural exchange between people from all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a tool for easier managmente of the camping, we incorporate a booking system in the Del cobre climbing's website that would be easily access by the users and admins to have a control and history
            of the bookings of people visiting the camping area.
